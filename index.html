        <h2>My Core Values</h2>
        <nav>
        <h3>Integrity</h3>
            <li><strong>What it means to me:</strong> Acting honestly and doing what is right whether someone is there or not.</li>
            <li><strong>Where I learned this:</strong>Integreity is one of three core value in the Air Force. After serving nine years on Active Duty, I understand the improtance and severity of always being honest and doing the right thing.</li>
            <li><strong>Why it is important to me:</strong>Integrity is important to me because in certain situations, your word is all you have. Sometimes you have to put your trust into others. Having integrity makes having and sharing that trust easier. </li>
            <li><strong>Ramifications of not following this value:</strong>If you do not have integrity, then you will quickly lose people's trust. If people see and know you have integrity, they will know you are reliable and honest.</li>
        <h3>Compassion</h3>
            <li><strong>What it means to me:</strong>Showing kindness, respect, and empathy to others. Putting yourself in someone else's shoes.</li>
             <li><strong>Where I learned this:</strong>My mother always told me to be kind of other even if they are not so kind to me. She told me that we never know what someone is dealing with behind closed doors.</li>
            <li><strong>Why it is important to me:</strong>Compassion is important to me because even a small act of kindness can have a positive impact on someone else's life and even your own.  </li>
            <li><strong>Ramifications of not following this value:</strong>There might be a moment where you need compassion from someone, but they might share it since you did not show compassion for them when they needed it.</li>
        <h3>Pride in Your Work</h3>
            <li><strong>What it means to me:</strong>Performing tasks professionally and to the best of your ability. Showing pride and excellence in what you are doing and what you will accomplish.</li>
            <li><strong>Where I learned this:</strong>My father taught me to take pride in every task I accomplish no matter how big or small. By doing so, you can go home at night proud in knowing you gave it your all.</li>
            <li><strong>Why it is important to me:</strong>Showing pride in my work is important to me because passion can be contagious. You could inspire someone else to do something in their life if they see your pride and passion.</li>
            <li><strong>Ramifications of not following this value:</strong>Without pride, you could start slack and make mistakes in your work whether it is for school, a job, or even a hobby.</li>
        <h3>Accountability</h3>
            <li><strong>What it means to me:</strong>Taking responsibility for your actions even if there are ramifications. If there are problems, do what you can to rectify them and learn from your mistakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Where I learned this:</strong>I learned accountability by playing volleyball. I had to acknowledge and talk about mistakes I made in order to improve.</li>
            <li><strong>Why it is important to me:</strong>Accountability is important because you will never approve if you ignore the mistakes you are making. Having accountability will also show others that you have humility and honesty.</li>
            <li><strong>Ramifications of not following this value:</strong>If you do not have accountability, you will continue to make the same mistakes and you will lose trust and creditbility with others.</li>
